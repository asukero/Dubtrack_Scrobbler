# Dubtrack_Scrobbler
Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey user script to enable LastFM scrobbling on dubtrack.fm

# How to run it
Simply add the script Dubtrack_Scrobbler to your Greasemonkey/TamperMonkey add-on and replace 'apiKey' and 'apiSecret' with your own LastFM api credentials.

Right now all info output are displayed in the console maybe I'll work on a small UI in the future.
